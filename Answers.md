1) Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

This week I learned more about logger and middleware.

2) What is Express Middleware?

Express Middleware is like an extension of express. Middleware is also most of what express is, just under the hood.

3) How can a client send data to an API?



4) What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

If it returns code 200 or 201, then the request was successful. If there is a 400 or 404 then something was filled out wrong or with no information. They can also mean that what is being looked for in the application can not be found. A 500 code means that there is something wrong with the code and needs to be debugged.

5) What Express feature can we use to partition an application into sub-applications?

You can create sub-applications by simply configuring the application into smaller applications which makes for cleaner looking code.
